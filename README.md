# Snake-Game
This game is very similar to the google snake game. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible. The snake will grow in length if a
food item **(red item)** is consumed. If a coin **(yellow item)** is consumed, the snake will gain an extra life. If the snake hits the border or
hits itself and the snake does not have any extra lives, the game will end. If the snake has extra lives, the snake will be respawned at its current
length and the game will continue. At the end, the player will recieve a score.
